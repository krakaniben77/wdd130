        <p>My name is Benjamin Krakani, all the way from Ghana, football has been a big part of my life. It has
            taught me teamwork, determination and leadership qualities i apply in everything i do.
            Whether on the pitch or in my daily life, I always give my best effort. I believe life’s better when
            you’ve got a ball at your feet and a smile on your face😊
